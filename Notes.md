# My Notes
A data type is essential a classification the kind of data that a variable can store, such as number, string, boolean, etc. The data type tells the computer how to interpret and handle the data stored in variables. 

## Different Data Types
- String
- Number: Integer and Floats
- Boolean
- Lists
- Tuple: unlike lists, a tuple is immutable
- Sets: these are unindexed, unordered, and unchangeable (note: unchangeable does not mean immutable, this is different). 
- Dict: Dictionary
- None
